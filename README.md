## Prerequisites

- It is **strongly recommended** that students already took courses on:

    + Mathematics (freshman calculus, MAS101 & MAS102): proposition statement and proof
    + Data structures (CS206): linked list, stack, queue
    + Systems programming (CS230): memory layout
    + Programming languages (CS320): lambda calculus, interpreter

  Without a proper understanding of these topics, you will likely struggle in this course.

- Other recommendations which would help you in this course:

    + Basic understanding of computer architecture (CS311)
    + Programming experience in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)



## Grading & honor code

### Homework (80%)

### Midterm exam (20%)

The exam will evaluate your theoretical understanding of compiler theory.  There will not be a final
exam.

### Attendance (?%)

You should submit a token to the [Course Management](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr) website for each

## Communication

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues).  You are expected to read all
  announcements within 24 hours of their being posted.  It is highly recommended to watch the
  repository so that new announcements will automatically be delivered to you email address.

- Ask your questions via email **only if** they are either confidential or personal.  Otherwise, ask
  administrative questions in [this repository's issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs420/issues) and technical questions in [the
  helpdesk](https://github.com/kaist-cp/helpdesk).  Any questions failing to do so
  (e.g. email questions on course materials) will not be answered.

- Emails to the instructor or TAs should begin with "CS420:" in the subject line, followed by a
  brief description of the purpose of your email.  The content should at least contain your name and
  student number.  Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.
